# etch-a-sketch

## Introduction
This project aimed to enhance my skills in DOM manipulation by building a browser-based sketchpad, reminiscent of an Etch-A-Sketch toy. The goal is to create an interactive grid where users can "draw" by hovering over grid squares, dynamically changing their color. The project serves as a hands-on exercise in using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, particularly focusing on Flexbox for layout management. I also refined my problem-solving skills by frequently researching and applying JavaScript methods and CSS properties.

## Project Overview
The project involves creating a dynamic 16x16 grid of square div elements using JavaScript. When the user hovers over these squares, they change color, leaving a pixelated trail similar to drawing with a pen. Additional functionality includes a button that allows users to specify the number of squares per side for a new grid, regenerating the grid to the specified dimensions.

## Tools and Technologies Used
1. JavaScript
DOM Manipulation: Used extensively to dynamically create and manipulate grid elements.
Event Listeners: Applied to detect mouse hover events and respond by changing the grid squares' color.
User Interaction: JavaScript's prompt() function is used to capture user input for grid dimensions.
2. HTML
Basic Structure: Provides the skeleton of the webpage, including a container div to hold the grid.
Buttons: HTML button elements trigger JavaScript functions to reset and resize the grid.
3. CSS
Flexbox: Essential for aligning grid squares into a flexible, responsive grid layout.
Styling: CSS is used to define the size, color, and behavior of grid squares during user interaction.
Hover Effects: CSS properties are combined with JavaScript to create a responsive hover effect on grid squares.
4. Git & GitHub
Version Control: Git is used to track project progress through regular commits.
Repository Management: The project is hosted on GitHub, allowing for easy collaboration and version tracking.
